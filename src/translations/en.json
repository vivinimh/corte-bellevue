      "description": "Corte Belle Vue preserves an agricultural heritage of rare beauty. Part of it is cultivated with Lambrusco Grasparossa vines (both IGT and DOC), characterised by an intense ruby red colour and a fruity aroma with notes of black cherry and cherry. Lambrusco Salamino (both IGT and DOC) has a more intense colour and lively foam, with aromas of red fruit on the nose and a dry palate with pleasant acidity. Finally, a few rows of Trebbiano di Spagna grapes feed the family's vinegar cellar, a small collection of ten barrels, some dating back to the late 19th century. A tradition that tells the story of the slow magic of Aceto Balsamico di Modena DOC and DOP. An excellence that will soon be listed among UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage, a symbol of Emilian tradition and craftsmanship."
